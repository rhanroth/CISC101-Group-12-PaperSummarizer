Module 3: Guardrails

* **Missing/Empty Sections** → Flag in warnings and state “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”
  
* **Short Sections (<50 words)** → Flag as insufficient and state “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”
  
* **Hallucination Mitigation** → Summarize only provided text.
  
* **Long-Paper Chunking** → Break into manageable segments before summarization.
  
* **Strict Evidence Mode**
  
  * **Variable:** `evidence_mode`
    
  * **Option:** `evidence_mode = "strict"`
    
  * Behavior:
    
    * Only include claims, equations, and results explicitly present in the source text.
      
    * If insufficient detail is found, output:
      
      * “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”
